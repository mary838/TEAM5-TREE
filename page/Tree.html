          Fighting climate change is one of the most critical challenges
          humanity faces today. It requires collective efforts across various
          sectors and levels—from governments and businesses to individuals—due

        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 30px">
          These trees play a vital role in their ecosystems by producing copious
          amounts of foliage that provide food and shelter for a variety of
          species and enrich the soil through the decomposition of their leaves.
          Other plants and animals benefit from sunlight reaching the ground
          during the winter months due to the seasonal loss of leaves. Temperate
          temperatures are ideal for deciduous trees, as their growth and
          dormancy cycles are determined by seasonal variations. These kinds of
          trees are found in the woodlands of Europe and North America.

        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 30px">
          Coniferous trees, with their needle-like leaves and waxy coatings, are
          adapted to conserve water. They are predominantly found in cooler or
          drier regions, such as the northern parts of North America, Europe,
          and Asia. Species like Pine, Fir, and Spruce are essential for
          year-round habitats, offering protection and food sources for
          wildlife. Their resilience and slow decomposition make them ideal for
          long-lasting wood products and crucial for soil protection against
          erosion.

        <h1 class="card-title">LARCH TREE</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 30px">
          Larch trees are deciduous conifers, but they differ greatly from their
          fellow conifers in one way. Like most conifer trees, larch trees
          thrive in colder climates, but unlike them, larch trees drop their
          needles during the colder months, regrowing them in the springtime.
          This makes larch trees unique amongst their conifer counterparts. The
          telltale sign of a larch tree is its yellow-golden needles in autumn.
          Because they shed their needles annually, larch trees tend to be
          hardier than conifer trees. These trees are also home to many
          different species throughout the forest, including red squirrels and
          caterpillars.

          In the Spring, the new leaves and flowers combine for a pastel tint on
          the limbs. In the Summer, it is a superior shade tree, with wide
          vibrant dark green to blue-green leaves. In the Fall, the leaves are
          rich with deep red and burgundy colors, and the acorns attract an
          array of wildlife. In the Winter, it presents a stately silhouette
          with light gray bark and a wide open crown. The White Oak can live for
          centuries becoming more picturesque with age.

          Jeffrey's Pine is a large, long-lived needled evergreen tree native to
          Oregon south through Baja California and can be confused with the
          ponderosa pine. The Jeffrey pine can occupy many sites from the edges
          of moist, high mountain meadows to arid slopes bordering deserts and
          it will grow over a wide range of elevations but usually above 5000
          ft. It grows in harsh and infertile sites and is tolerant of drought
          and cold weather. It can grow up to 140 feet tall in ideal conditions.
          Its preference is for gravelly to sandy moist soils in full sun. Due
          to the size of this tree, it is best used in naturalized areas. May do
          well in the mountains of NC but may not tolerate the heat and humidity
          of the Piedmont and coastal areas.
